The .. argument to cd will take the directory up by one. What I mean by this is that if you type the command 

```cd ..    
        ``` it will take you to the previous directory from 
```/Users/jarrodjones/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_5``` 
to ```/Users/jarrodjones/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises```



> cd to the joe directory with one command.

```cd ~learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_4/tmp/stuff/things/frank/joe```

> cd back to temp with one command, but not further above that.

```cd ../ ../ ../ ../ ../ ../ ../```

> Find out how to cd to your "home directory" with one command.

```cd ~```

> cd to your Documents directory, then find it with your GUI file browser (Finder, Windows Explorer, etc.).

```cd Documents/```

> cd to your Downloads directory, then find it with your file browser.

```cd Downloads/```

> Find another directory with your file browser, then cd to it.
Remember when you put quotes around a directory with spaces in it? You can do that with any command. For example, if you
have a directory I Have Fun, then you can do: cd "I Have Fun"
