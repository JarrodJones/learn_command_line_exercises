Yes you can remove the tmp directory by typing 
```
rmdir tmp/
```
while you are in the chapter_7 directory.

Jarrods-MacBook-Pro-2:chapter_7 $ rmdir tmp/
rmdir: tmp/: Directory not empty
```

When typing that command you receive an error because the directory is not empty. With that being said...it negates my 
answer to question 1, at this time we cannot remove the tmp directory.
