1) What directory are you in?

Pwd or print working directory.

2) Are you in the class directory?

/Users/jarrodjones/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/

3) Are you in your home directory?

Pwd  Users/jarrodjones

4) What directory did you run that command in?

I ran that command in my home directory and then I proceeded to run it in the class directory as well.
/Users/jarrodjones & Users/jarrodjones/workspace/davinci_coders_t1_2016/

The process for finding out what directory you are currently in is as simple as typing "pwd" into the terminal.
To do the same process using the Macs finder you would have to open the finder, scroll down the left pane until you find
the "user" which in my case is named jarrodjones. After you've found your user file you'll need to double click on it in
order to open it. Once you have the user directory open you'll need to find the "workspace" directory and open it. 
Inside the "workspace" directory you'll find the "davinci_coders_t1_2016" file and inside of that will be all of the 
class folders.
